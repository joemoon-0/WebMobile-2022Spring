## In-Class Programming (ICP) Description

1. Rock-Paper-Scissors(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock–paper–scissors)
   a. Build the game of rock paper scissors using JavaScript
   b. A basic UI will be necessary
   c. Hint: You can use a random number generator and conditional statements to build the application (by comparing the numbers)

2. RWD Task
   a. Create a page that looks like the below mockup
   b. Download the starter code(source code)
   c. Follow the TODO instructions in the 'input.html' file
   d. Make the page responsive and check its responsiveness as the screen size increases or decreases
   e. The font in the mockup looks different from what we have in the code now
   f. Find the closest possible font to the one in the mockup and replace the existing font with it (Hint: Visit https://fonts.google.com/ and look for "Play," "Rambla," "Lato," "Orbitron." One of them might be the font we need!)
   g. Two colored squares and their respective hexadecimal numbers are given on the left side serve as only a reference for the colors used for the text content in the mockup
   h. They are not a part of the final page that we build. Make the page as close as possible to the mockup. You can use your images, though.
