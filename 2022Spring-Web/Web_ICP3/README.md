## In-Class Programming (ICP) Description

1. Rock-Paper-Scissors(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock–paper–scissors) <br>
   a. Build the game of rock paper scissors using JavaScript <br>
   b. A basic UI will be necessary <br>
   c. Hint: You can use a random number generator and conditional statements to build the application (by comparing the numbers) <br>

2. RWD Task <br>
   a. Create a page that looks like the below mockup <br>
   b. Download the starter code(source code) <br>
   c. Follow the TODO instructions in the 'input.html' file <br>
   d. Make the page responsive and check its responsiveness as the screen size increases or decreases <br>
   e. The font in the mockup looks different from what we have in the code now <br>
   f. Find the closest possible font to the one in the mockup and replace the existing font with it (Hint: Visit https://fonts.google.com/ and look for "Play," "Rambla," "Lato," "Orbitron." One of them might be the font we need!) <br>
   g. Two colored squares and their respective hexadecimal numbers are given on the left side serve as only a reference for the colors used for the text content in the mockup <br>
   h. They are not a part of the final page that we build. Make the page as close as possible to the mockup. You can use your images, though. <br>
